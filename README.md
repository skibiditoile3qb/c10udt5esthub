A very bad website. . .
This website is used mainly for software, a way to obtain victims info if ran. 
This is the server that takes victim details, and hosts them through a firewall, so only the host can see the details. 

HOW TO USE:
First clone this repo, and change password details in the code
Then host this website on any webservice, such as render if you're broke like me.
Make a program that uses this website to store stuff from the victim's computer.
and finally. . . go into your website, click admin, and see the info roll in.
